# Gears 4 Peers
- Coder Factory Academy Semester 2 project
- A two-sided market place for users to rent extreme sports' equipment

## Overview
- Problem:
  * Expensive sports equipment are only being used every now and then and are not fully utilised
- Solution:
  * A two-sided marketplace that allows owners to rent out their equipment for other sports enthusiasts to use
- Target Market:
  * Travellers, sports enthusiasts, beginners at a particular sport, lovers of the outdoors, trainers
  * Strongest Market: Traveling sports enthusiasts
    * Why? - They will no longer need to bring their sports equipment while traveling and are now able to travel light. They are not restricted by work (or study) Monday to Friday and are able to rent the equipment all days of the week.
